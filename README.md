A DCGANs-based model for detecting deepfaked/synthesized audio files.

1. Utilizes Mel-Spectrogram for the discriminator's architecture to classify real and fake audio.
2. Utilizes several optimizer method (EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, AdamW weight decay, etc.).
3. Utilizes The Fake-or-Real (FoR) Dataset (deepfake audio).
4. .keras is the model itself and .ipynb is the notebook of said model.
